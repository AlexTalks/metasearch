# Metasearch config file. Anywhere in this file, you can reference environment
# variables using placeholders such as ${FOOBAR} that Metasearch will expand at
# runtime.

# An "engine" is an individual content source, e.g. Confluence. All supported
# engines are listed below.
#
# You should customize the config values (required unless stated otherwise) for
# all engines that you plan to use and simply delete the entries for any engines
# that you don't plan to use.
#
# Each engine's config accepts an optional `name` key (not shown in this
# example) that you may declare to override the engine's default name for
# display purposes, e.g. `name: Employee directory` in Pingboard's config.

    # credentials file accessible from inside the container. One way to do so is
    # by entering `/data/credentials.json` as this option's value and supplying
    # to `docker run` an additional flag that mounts the host file to that path:
