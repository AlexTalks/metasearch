# Metasearch config file. Anywhere in this file, you can reference environment

# An "engine" is an individual content source, e.g. Confluence. All supported
# engines are listed below. You should customize the config values (required
# unless stated otherwise) for all engines that you plan to use and simply
# delete the entries for any engines that you don't plan to use.

    # Note that if you run Metasearch using Docker, you need to make the host's
    # credentials file accessible from inside the container. One way to do so is
    # by entering `/data/credentials.json` as this option's value and supplying
    # to `docker run` an additional flag that mounts the host file to that path:
    # `-v '/path/to/credentials.json:/data/credentials.json'`
